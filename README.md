# GeneDrop
A Gene-Dropping Program Written In R

This is quite early on in development so I'm sure there are lots of mistakes and errors which I'm more than happy for anyone to point out.  If you think the program may be useful to your research but doesn't quite seem to do what you want please let me know, I'll see if I can make it happen.  Similarly if anything doesn't work I'll take a look as quickly as possible.
